Image Recognition:
imagenet: Collection of machine learning images.

Splitting images into pieces -> Tiling posters and stuff
Piece inventory:
Choose a set of 200 Pieces to make near-copies of each Image

minimize difference: Sum(Copy - Image)
where Copy(x,y) = Sum(weight x piece)

Lead to recognition that images are made of lines. (Done for black and white pictures.)

Idea: Combine a smaller bit inventory into more bit inventories, assembling larger units in stages.
First stage contains lines.
Second stage recognizes elements like nose, ears, mouth, eyes, wheels, doors.

Questions:

language translations for odd languages?
Intermediate translation. Norwegian -> English -> ...
Sometimes languages are badly translated if words move a lot.

Can you do deepmind on the raspberry pi at home?
Some yes, some no. Better to get more. Done on a weekend with Google capacities.

Where do you see machine learning in 2-5 years, and what are the great walls you are running up against right now?
Hard to predict, but much changed with deep learning in the last few years. Perceptual problems work pretty well,
[stream cut out]. Long term planning is a problem.
